    <h1><b>Crowds of sculpted stone birds on top of roofs</b><br>
        <font size="-2">Posted on July 2, 2022</font></h1>
        <p>
        By the window listening to the rolling autumn rain. I let my tea go cold, that's not a good
        feeling. It's still okay. <br>
        It rained so much I had to wait inside a café while cars were flying past and people fled
        with umbrellas. In the afternoon though, I got to go to the top of a dome to draw from the 
        vantage point lofty places are ; I took the drawing book with the marbled cover. A few days 
        ago I was with a friend who explained each item in a sketchbook, and a collection of 
        pictures of reference. I wish I could buy published and bound books like that. Of images, 
        related through intuition and taste and forming a symphony of sorts, with some words. A 
        notebook, really is what I mean. Something which is an expression of the maker's sensitivity to pictures and words,
        and what they think should be recorded, without the finish that most books have, or the 
        perceived necessity to make it all cohere, a manual of colour and style.  <br>
        I waited for the bus. I had left the window open and it was cold when I came back, some rain had 
        fallen inside, some paper had blown away from where it was before, but everything was intact.

        <h1><b>Tuesday Vows</b><br>
        <font size="-2">Posted on June 21, 2022</font></h1>
        <p>
        I went through an avenue of trees this morning
        which was cut across by a railway line, then
        continued on the other side. 
        I've had a good day away from the usual things.
        <br><br>
        I dreamt that I was sticking up notices on windows with green frames in a 
        corner of a square. In the street was someone I went to 
        school with who I barely knew at all and a tall man singing in an
        incomprehensible language. <br>
        There are often these street-like courtyards in my dreams. One time I had a
        meeting with someone in a vast square of gorgeous old buildings which 
        backed onto a park. I cycled from busy streets into the square and waited
        for them on a low wall. <br> 
        More recently I was in such a square in London 
        specifically, waiting for a wedding some hours away. Nicely-dressed people
        moved awkwardly around, waiting. A dog watched from the 
        shade; only she, of all the occupants of this dream, seemed to be alive. 
        Everything was still and quiet, in anticipation or apprehension.
        There was a bookcase in the middle of the street, stuffed with books
        that were falling apart. The deterioration was deliberate; they weren't very
        old books at all. I was having a conversation about them with two people
        older than me who held champagne glasses, but unfortunately I have forgotten
        which book it was that I took from the shelf while I spoke.
        <br><br>
        On my way back home it was getting dark, I looked into the warm glowing 
        windows behind black garden railings at the old faces at their desks. 
        </p>

        <h1><b>Intermission</b><br>
        <font size="-2">Posted on June 14, 2022</font></h1>
        <p>
        I've got some books from a second hand book-fair. I
        left a message on a wall of messages, all handwritten
        and pinned on top of each other. Someone on the tram
        had a national anthem play when their phone rang. And
        I found a round side-table to put books and things on.
        <br><br>
        I'm looking up at the slanting roof geometry. The
        window is open even though it's cold and wintry, 
        because I like the evening air. I haven't turned the 
        lights on yet, it's just become darker and gloomier 
        slowly as we all turn.

        <h1><b>Amirador</b><br>
        <font size="-2">Posted on May 16, 2022</font></h1>
        <p>
        My remarkable friend has an amazing flat which is 
        disorganised in a good way; there are 
        two desks, both of dark wood, one in a very small
        alcove with a window, mismatching chairs and armchairs
        in the middle of the room with an antique coffee table,
        all atop a faded rug, and a bluish-grey sofa
        close by. Beside one desk, pinned vertically up the
        wall are drawings, old ones mixed with new ones, mostly
        of flowers. Her drawings suffice anyway but she doesn't
        actually keep real flowers, and if she does for some
        reason, they end up dead and wilted until I or someone
        else visits and gets rid of them. <br><br>
        The room has blue patterned wallpaper for the most part
        but the wall with the door is of a different paper.
        Bookshelves in the 
        corner; almost floor to ceiling, on the 
        corner face of each wall. And this arrangement is 
        mirrored diagonally opposite in the corner on the right 
        entering the room. Wallpaper from there across to the 
        window above the sofa. Lots of books stacked on the 
        floor, old lamps with fabric shades. The opposite wall 
        to the one with the recessed-desk has two windows with 
        thick curtains, there's another chair
        looking out one of them, with clothes thrown across it,
        like most of the furniture. Mismatched pillows, she
        sleeps on the sofa (doesn't believe in beds) so there 
        are blankets always strewn across it, and books 
        underneath it. <br><br>
        And she acts like it isn't anything special but she must
        have accumulated the things for years. She has contrasted
        all of these styles and it works so well. Entering
        from the door, there is another small wing on the left,
        which I am in now, the wallpaper is different and here is 
        the small kitchen. The roof, which is wooden, slants and 
        the windows here have frames that match the roof wood 
        (the others are painted white). The bathroom is attached 
        to here, with cream-beige walls and black and white tiles 
        and very singular light fittings.
        <br><br>
        oh I am also learning French now

        <p>
        It had just stopped raining in a dark city; very dark, 
        only a few lamp-like windows. I was walking up low, stone 
        steps that made no logical sense, then back down a slope 
        into a carpark overgrown with wet elm trees. Empty fields 
        of grey and brown were beyond it. 
        <br><br>
        Another dream involved an installation in a dream-library.
        A display which formed sphinxes and obelisks from levitating 
        strands of light and matter, moving outwards from the back of 
        the room, over bookshelves and our heads. The room was at an 
        unbearable slant. I was watching with the architect of this 
        installation, she was showing it off proudly, like artists do.
        <br><br>
        There is a brown tree with yellow leaves in a crumbled 
        courtyard that I keep walking past. I will get a picture. 
        <br><br>
        It is autumn, the best time of year, “the king of seasons” 
        with the best colours. Autumn and the late afternoon are 
        inextricable. They're the same sensation, the same colours.

        <h1><b>Gravestone</b><br>
        <font size="-2">Posted on March 31, 2022</font></h1>
        <p>
        I asked him what he thought of the pictures I brought him, 
        but before I finished he begged; ‘Do you hear that?’
        <br>
        ‘Hear what?’ I replied. 
        <br>
        ‘Three dead men riding north,’ he said.
        <br><br>
        Once I found a man in a quiet dark room, far from the world
        that I had come from, sitting bent on the corner of a tomb. 
        Around him were trinkets and golden cups, shields, old 
        intricate instruments, gilded books, a seemly accumulation of treasure. He 
        couldn't turn to face me, he just asked 
        quietly, ‘have you come to rob me?’ I said that I had not. 
        Then he thought he knew me; he might have supposed that if I 
        hadn’t come to rob him I might be his saviour; he said he was 
        surprised to hear my voice. I took a step closer, and saw 
        better the glittering treasure but was unmoved by it. I had 
        everything I could ever want in the Greenhouse downstairs. I 
        asked whether he had prepared himself for the afterlife with 
        this elaborate display, but he said no: ‘I just thought to 
        arrange these together. That was some time ago now. Tell me, what is it like there?’ 
        I asked him where exactly he meant. ‘The other world,’ he replied. 
        ‘Tell me.’
        <br>
        ‘The other world is evanescent and withered,’ I said 
        reflexively. He seemed very disappointed. 
        <br>
        ‘Do you know,’ he said with effort, ‘I have dreamed of late of 
        ladders made of thorns.’ I was surprised; ‘so have I!’ I said. 
        <br>
        ‘And did you climb them?’ he pressed.
        <br>
        ‘No, but my companion did. They took pleasure from it.’ He 
        didn't respond. ‘I ran away,’ I added. ‘That afternoon, I was 
        close to the other world. I could hear its discordance.’ 
        <br>
        He somehow became even more bent and crooked and sighed for what felt like a very long time.
