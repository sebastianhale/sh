    Two things converged today which I've been waiting for: <i>Vortex</i>, and 
    <i>Bento's Sketchbook</i> by John Berger. That book has been so difficult to 
    get ahold of. They seem related, or at least I've related the two; they agree with 
    each other it seems to me. I'll have to read the book to see whether there is any 
    more basis for that than my difficult to explain association. Probably not. I don't
    know whether there is some benefit to thinking about the link between 
    the two things, or whether that's helpful for me to understand them better.
    <br><br>
    The interior in <i>Vortex</i> was my favourite part, which is a bit like a burrow and is 
    filled with the belongings of long lives, and has an unmistakable warmth less
    present in the house of <i>Amour</i>, a movie which this one will definitely be compared with. <br>
    In <i>Vortex</i> the home faces a blank wall, which often makes it seem the 
    characters are looking into a white void; an exceptional bit of design. 
    The warmth in the home is taken away with the belongings of 
    the characters - homes and belongings are for the living. The end very much pronounces the 
    reduction; images of absence are more effective than images of death in the
    cinema. Why the characters don't eat at all I can't come up with an explanation
    for, or how it affects the way I see them; the absence is very noticeable though. <br>
    I also have to gush over Dario Argento and Fran√ßoise Lebrun in this, I adore the former and
    am astonished at how good he is at acting. 
    <br><br>
    Something about some of the later Berger work is that it feels like it could have
    been written by someone who was dead; both literally, as if the pages had 
    materialised from behind the curtain or were slipped through the floorboards, 
    and in the sense that it might have been discovered in a silent old studio whose
    occupant is not alive anymore. Something to do with the quality of observation 
    and reflection gives me that impression, and possibly the fact that in particular 
    stories the dead take such a physical presence, with a rambling memory and 
    established sense of place in the world, and self, which nobody alive can have, 
    at least not to the same level. While reading I trust the reality of this 
    completely. Maybe it's because to read his writing is now a similar act. It feels
    like sorting through memories in suspension of finding the right one. <br> 
    I can imagine having a drawing by him in a small, square frame. I think I should copy one.
    If I think of him closely while I do it, it might invoke his hand.

        I went to the graveyard this evening for the space and quiet. No one was
        around so I could talk aloud to myself without a mask on, which is good for concealing mute mutterings. It really didn't
        seem to have anyone around in any plane of being, except one person close
        to the gate who was tapping something onto a tombstone with a small hammer.
        The cemetery sort of is the afterlife. All those obelisks and either dead
        trees or cypress-looking trees, and it felt like the wind had been sucked away. <br>
        I would not like a portrait on my grave. Although I wouldn't like to be in
        a graveyard really, maybe just deep in a patch of ground far away. Which is 
        possible if I am murdered in a countryside village.

        Hello, this is the beginning of my blog and website. I will endeavour to
        make both more pleasing to look at and work on telephones, it's a bit old-fashioned
        but that has some character. I'll furnish it with pictures too, when I find
        adequate scanning facilities. <br>
        To look out for is a section of fictional correspondence, a gallery titled
        The Starving Museum (because it isn't satisfied by what paltry things it is
        given), The Greenhouse, which you might have noticed on the home-page, and
        lots of minor amusing things. And blog updates. Come what may.
