        I went to the graveyard this evening for the space and quiet. No one was
        around so I could talk aloud to myself without a mask on. It really didn't
        seem to have anyone around in any plane of being, except one person close
        to the gate who was tapping something onto a tombstone with a small hammer.
        The cemetery sort of is the afterlife. All those obelisks and either dead
        trees or cypress-looking trees, and it felt like the wind had been sucked away. <br>
        I would not like a portrait on my grave. Although I wouldn't like to be in
        a graveyard really, maybe just deep in a patch of ground far away. Which is 
        possible if I am murdered in a countryside village.

        Hello, this is the beginning of my blog, and website. Work will be done to
        make both more pleasing to look at and all that, it's a bit old-fashioned
        but that has some character. I'll furnish it with pictures too, when I find
        adequate scanning facilities. <br>
        To look out for is a section of fictional correspondence, a gallery titled
        The Starving Museum (because it isn't satisfied by what paltry things it is
        given), The Greenhouse, which you might have noticed on the home-page, and
        lots of minor amusing things. And blog updates. Come what may.
